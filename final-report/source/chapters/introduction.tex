\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
How are genes interconnected within a biological system? 
Which genes play the most central roles in maintaining the organisation and functionality of the network? 
And do these interactions form cohesive functional modules or rather a loosely connected structure?

Understanding these questions is fundamental in biology, as the structure of gene and protein interaction networks often reflects the organisation of the underlying cellular processes.
By representing biological systems as graphs — where nodes correspond to genes and edges represent genetic interactions — we can apply concepts from graph theory to uncover hidden patterns of regulation and connectivity.

In particular, analysing centrality measures allows us to identify hub genes that may act as key regulators, while studying clustering and community structures reveals how these genes group into functional modules. 

The BIO-CE-GN dataset, representing genetic interactions in \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, provides an ideal test case for such an analysis. 
By combining centrality and clustering analyses, we aim to characterise the network’s topology and gain insight into how complex biological behaviour can emerge from simple patterns of connection.

\subsection{Objectives}
The main objective of this project is to analyse the structure of the BIO-CE-GN gene interaction network by applying several graph-theoretical measures. 
Specifically, we aim to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify central genes using centrality metrics such as \textbf{degree}, \textbf{betweenness}, and \textbf{PageRank};
    \item Evaluate the \textbf{clustering} and \textbf{community structure} to detect functional gene modules;
    \item Compare different centrality measures to assess their biological interpretability and computational scalability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset Overview}
The \textbf{BIO-CE-GN dataset} consists of experimentally derived genetic interactions among genes of \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, a well-studied model organism. 
Each node represents a gene, and each edge denotes an experimentally verified genetic interaction. 
The dataset provides both directional and weighted information, indicating the type and strength of interactions.  

The network contains 2,220 nodes and 53,683 edges, with an average degree of 48.36 and a density of 0.0218.  
The graph is composed of 3 connected components.
This dataset enables the exploration of complex topological properties that may correspond to real biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

The primary goal is to characterise the connectivity and community structure of the gene interaction network derived from \textit{C. elegans}. 
We aim to identify critical genes (hubs or regulators), analyse modularity, and study how topological patterns relate to biological functionality.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

Before performing any analysis, we cleaned and formatted the dataset to ensure compatibility with network analysis libraries. 
This involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removing self-loops and duplicated edges;
    \item Handling missing or inconsistent identifiers;
    \item Converting the data into an \textbf{edge list} format suitable for the \texttt{networkx} Python library.
\end{itemize}

In addition, we removed self-loops and converted the dataset into a simple undirected graph in order to compute centrality measures consistently.  
All preprocessing steps were performed in Python using the NetworkX library.

\subsection{Graph Representation}

The dataset was represented as an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( V \) represents the set of genes;
    \item \( E \) represents the genetic interactions between them.
\end{itemize}

The graph was constructed using the \texttt{networkx} library, which provides efficient tools for computing network metrics such as centrality, clustering coefficients, and community structures.

\subsection{Algorithms Used}

We computed several network metrics to analyse different aspects of the network:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Degree Centrality:} Measures the number of connections each gene has, identifying highly connected hub genes.
    \item \textbf{Betweenness Centrality:} Quantifies how often a gene lies on the shortest paths between other genes, identifying key regulatory genes.
    \item \textbf{PageRank:} Evaluates the relative importance of genes based on their connectivity to other important genes.
    \item \textbf{Clustering Coefficient:} Determines the tendency of genes to form tightly connected groups, representing potential biological modules.
    \item \textbf{Average Neighbor Degree:} Indicates how the connectivity of a gene correlates with that of its neighbours.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intended Experiments}

In the following experiments, we will examine the BIO-CE-GN dataset to describe its main topological and biological characteristics.
We exported the top-ranked nodes for each centrality measure and generated summary plots.  
These results will be used in the next stage of the project for biological interpretation and pathway validation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph preprocessing} — Represent the dataset as an undirected gene–gene interaction network after removing self-loops and duplicated edges.
    \item \textbf{Network properties} — Compute basic network metrics such as node and edge counts, degree distribution, and connectivity. \\
     After preprocessing, the network contains 2,220 nodes and 53,683 edges, 
     with an average degree of 48.36 and a density of 0.0218. 
     We also computed centrality scores for all nodes and generated the Pearson 
     correlation matrix between degree, betweenness and PageRank.
    \item \textbf{Centrality and correlation} — Calculate degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities, and analyze their correlations to identify neurons or genes with high centrality.  
    \item \textbf{Clustering relevance} — Explore communities and assess whether clustered nodes are involved in known biological pathways.  
    \item \textbf{Visualization and scalability} — Visualize main structures and test algorithm performance on larger datasets.
\end{itemize}

Analysis for all the above steps will be performed using \textbf{Python}, \textbf{NetworkX}, and \textbf{Jupyter Notebook} on local machines.
