\textbf{Use of AI Tools.}  

ChatGPT was used as a technical assistant to configure and debug the \texttt{latex.yml} workflow for GitHub Actions, which was previously unfamiliar. 
It was also employed to refine the structure of the LaTeX source files and correct minor syntax issues. 
No automatic code generation, data analysis, or content writing was delegated to AI tools; all project concepts, structure, and implementation were developed by the authors.
